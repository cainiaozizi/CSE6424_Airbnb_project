### CSE6424_Airbnb_project
Airbnb’s operation has been affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 due to increasing concerns on health and safety for travelling and lodging. Using Austin as a test case, this project aims at improving Airbnb’s user features by providing more current related information such as the forecast COVID-19 cases and the statistic relating to safety like the crime rate on the lodging neighbors for holiday seasons of 2020.
Nowadays travelers are spending tremendous amount of time on researching the spread of COVID-19, the location, safety and price of lodging for their destinations since currently these information are all fragmented and dispersed in the internet. While Airbnb posts their latest response to COVID-19, it provides no specific information relating to the virus’s geographical distribution and its trend. Other information about crime activity, population density and so on are also rarely found in the official website. Integrated information is on demand to help customers visualize the potential risks on traveling. 
Here we propose an improved lodging planner which provides integrated information combining COVID, crime activity, population density and so on. In order to evaluate and validate the outcomes of our planner website, we will be conducting surveys, and comparing the prediction results with the actual cases numbers around Thanksgiving.
